Original code from https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui/blob/1.x/dearpygui/demo.py

The demo_dcg.py script is an equivalent script showing the features of DearCyGui

dearpygui_on_dearcygui.py is a demo wrapper that converts a subset of DearPyGui to DearCyGui.
It is not complete and more could be implemented in the wrapper (For many missing parts,
the DearCyGui equivalent exists).

demo_dpg_wrapper.py is a subset of DearPyGui's demo.py script that works with the demo wrapper
